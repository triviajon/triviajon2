<h1> <i>more</i> about me. </h1>
<h3> committee of math majors </h3>
<p> i was a member of the <b>committee of math majors</b> (<a href="http://comm.mit.edu/">comm</a>).
the comm is a small, selective group of mathematics undergraduates who dedicate their time to collecting data and 
creating actionables to improve the math department at mit. this includes coordinating with faculty members to improve the
advising process for both students and faculty advisors. i had multiple focuses: at one point, it was on running multiple discussion forums
with faculty and students, where we discussed community building and academics within the department. later, i worked on
maintaining the <a href="http://course18.guide/">mathematics underground guide</a>. </p>

<h3> asymptones acapella </h3>

<a href="http://asymptones.mit.edu/">acapella group</a> (spring 2023, fall 2023). 
i also served as publicity chair (spring 2024), assistant musical director (spring 2022, fall 2022), social chair (fall 2022), and wrote (or helped) several arrangements:</p>
